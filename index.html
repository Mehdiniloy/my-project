          It's not how much we give but how musch love we put into giving.
          Making a donation is the ultimate sign of solidarity. <br />Actions
          speak louder than words. The measure of a life, After all, is not it's
          duration, But it's DONATION.

          Giving is not just about making a donation. It is about making a
          difference. <br />We make a living by what we get. We make a life by
          what we give.
